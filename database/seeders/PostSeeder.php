                Among those details is what will power the G90. It will use a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The company didn't provide any additional details, but it will likely make 375 horsepower, as the engine does in the G80 sedan. Rear-wheel and all-wheel drive will probably be available, too."

One piece of information we didnâ€™t have at the time was its price. Now, Hyundai has announced Ioniq 5 pricing for all three trims in both rear- and all-wheel drive, along with pricing for the standard-range version that will arrive later. Pricing starts at $40,925, which includes $1,225 in destination fees, but doesnâ€™t account for the available $7,500 federal tax credit or other local incentives."

There are five styles in total, three for men, two for women. Since these Western-themed cowboy specials are based on the $58,565 10th Anniversary Limited Longhorn Edition, which lives at the opposite end of the trim range to Tradesman, the Lucchese models can cost more than 10 times the Wolverines. Whereas the entry-level Wolverine Tradesman cost $229, the top-dog Lucchese men's Tooled Western Boot runs $2,495."
